## Product

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Vendor | Gardyn |
| Product | Gardyn Home Kit 1.0, 2.0, 3.0; Gardyn Studio 1.0, 2.0 |
| Component | Device operating system |
| Affected Versions | Firmware < master.619 |

## Summary

Gardyn Home Kit devices ship with default credentials for SSH access. The devices run on Raspberry Pi hardware with Raspbian (Debian 9 Stretch, EOL) and retain default or weak credentials for system accounts present on the device.

## Vulnerability Details

### Device Platform

Gardyn devices are built on Raspberry Pi Model 3B+ hardware running Raspbian 9 (Stretch), which reached end-of-life in June 2022 and receives no security patches.

### System Accounts

The device firmware ships with pre-configured user accounts:

```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
hybriponics148:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/hybriponics148:/usr/bin/zsh
yplant148:x:1002:1002:,,,:/home/yplant148:/bin/bash
```

### The `hybriponics148` Account

This is a vendor development account with:
- Home directory at `/home/hybriponics148/`
- Shell access via `/usr/bin/zsh`
- Pre-staged SSH authorized keys for vendor-only remote access
- Account name matches the build environment path found in unstripped binaries: `/home/hybriponics148/work/gardyn-pi/services/`

### Vendor-Only Remote Access

The vendor deploys a single SSH authorized key to the `hybriponics148` account via OTA updates, providing persistent vendor-only remote access. The device owner:
- Has no SSH keys provisioned
- Has no local access mechanism
- Cannot audit device state
- Cannot verify what software is running
- Is not informed of vendor access

### End-of-Life Operating System

| Component | Version | EOL Date | Status |
|-----------|---------|----------|--------|
| Debian | 9 (Stretch) | June 30, 2022 | No security patches |
| Linux Kernel | 4.x | — | Unpatched known CVEs |
| OpenSSL | 1.1.x | — | Unpatched known CVEs |

## Impact

- Direct device access via default credentials (on firmware with SSH enabled)
- Vendor retains persistent remote access via pre-staged SSH keys without owner knowledge
- Device owner has no local access mechanism and cannot audit device state
- End-of-life operating system (Debian 9 Stretch, EOL June 2022) receives no security patches

## Remediation

**Recommended mitigations for device owners:**

- Isolate the Gardyn device on a dedicated VLAN or IoT network segment
- Monitor for SSH (port 22) activity on the device's IP address
- Block outbound SSH from the device at the firewall

**Recommended fix for the vendor:**

1. Remove default and development accounts from production firmware images
2. Generate unique per-device credentials during manufacturing
3. Migrate from EOL Debian 9 to a supported operating system
4. Provide device owners with a secure local access mechanism
5. Do not deploy vendor-only SSH keys without owner knowledge and consent
6. Strip debug symbols and build paths from production binaries
