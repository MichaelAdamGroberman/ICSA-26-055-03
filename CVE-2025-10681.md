# CVE-2025-10681: Hardcoded Azure Blob Storage Account Key

## Product

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Vendor | Gardyn |
| Product | Gardyn Home Kit 1.0, 2.0, 3.0; Gardyn Studio 1.0, 2.0 |
| Component | Device firmware, mobile application |
| Affected Versions | All firmware versions, Mobile App all versions |

## Summary

The Azure Blob Storage account key for the `gardyniotblob` storage account is hardcoded in both the Gardyn device firmware and mobile application. This account-level credential grants access to all blob containers including OTA firmware updates, device logs, and camera images from approximately 115,000 devices.

## Vulnerability Details

### Exposed Storage Accounts

| Account | Purpose | Access Level |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `gardyniotblob` | Camera images, device logs, OTA updates | Account key (full access) |
| `gardynappprod` | Timelapse videos | Account key (full access) |
| `gardyniotblobsmall` | Thumbnail images | Account key (full access) |

### Credential Location

The storage account key is embedded in:

1. **Device firmware** — plaintext in configuration files under `/usr/local/etc/gardyn/`
2. **Mobile application** — React Native Hermes bytecode in `index.android.bundle`

### Accessible Containers

Enumeration using the extracted key revealed multiple containers:

| Container | Content | Access |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `iot-camera-image` | Home interior camera images (~115,000 cameras) | Read/Write |
| `device-log` | Device diagnostic logs (5+ years) | Read/Write |
| `videos` | Timelapse recordings | Read |
| `ota-updates` | Firmware update packages | Read/Write |

Write access to the `ota-updates` container enables supply chain attacks via firmware tampering (see Gr0m-049).

## Impact

- Read access to home interior camera images from approximately 115,000 Gardyn cameras
- Read/write access to OTA firmware update storage — enables supply chain attacks
- Access to 5+ years of device diagnostic logs
- Storage cost attacks via arbitrary blob uploads
- Combined with Gr0m-049 (OTA firmware tampering), the architectural access could enable remote code execution on devices that download tampered firmware

## Remediation

**Recommended mitigations for device owners:**

- Isolate the Gardyn device on a dedicated VLAN or IoT network segment
- Monitor for unexpected outbound connections from the device

**Recommended fix for the vendor:**

1. Rotate all Azure Storage account keys immediately
2. Remove hardcoded credentials from firmware and mobile application
3. Implement per-device scoped SAS tokens with minimal permissions
4. Set all containers to private access level
5. Implement code signing for OTA firmware packages
6. Add integrity verification for downloaded firmware
